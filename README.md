## How to Play the Game
The game consists of 16 cards, 8 pairs of special loot crate items you can actually receive in the game when going for a loot drop. 

**To get that coveted chicken dinner, the user needs to press play.**

**On each turn:**
- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying drop item.
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same drop item.
- If the cards match, both cards stay turned over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state.
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched - the iconic PUBG winning message is displayed.


**Special Features**
- The game features a timer to keep track of how long it takes to win and reports time on win screen
- The player starts out with a three chicken dinner rating -- but the rating drops the more moves it take to complete the game
- When the game ends, a pop-up appears with the elapsed time, final chicken rating, a restart button, and the infamous PUBG winning message
